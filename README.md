# Task 5 – AI Ethics & Bias Evaluation

This repository contains my submission for **Task 5: AI Ethics and Bias Evaluation** as part of the Intern Intelligence AI Internship.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to evaluate an AI model for fairness and bias, and to apply mitigation techniques to improve fairness.  
I used the **Adult Income Dataset**, trained a Logistic Regression model, and evaluated bias based on gender.  

## ⚖️ Results
- **Before Reweighing:**
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Disparate Impact: 0.276 (biased against women)

- **After Reweighing:**
  - Accuracy: 79%
  - Disparate Impact: 0.526 (improved fairness, though not perfect)

📊 A fairness comparison plot was also generated to visualize improvement.
